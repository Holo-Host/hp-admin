# NOTE: This File is for exclusively running the holofuel DNA with two agents.
##
# * Copy this file to conductor-config.toml and generate a unique agent key for each of the `agents` fields below:
#
# * Steps for creating an agent:
#    1. Run `hc keygen -n --path keystores/myagent.keystore`
#    2. Copy the public address hash and paste it as the value for the agent's `public_address`
